	I am a currently a sophomore at Gunn High School. Whenever I can, I volunteer, swim, or code. Although I am a beginner programmer, I learned Java, Python, Scheme, and some C++ on my free time. I want to teach coding so I can spread the joy of programming to other people.
<br><br>
Greetings,
<br>
My name is Larry Zhou and I am a rising sophomore at Gunn High School student. As a proactive member of the Palo Alto community I believe it is my responsibility to take action in support of Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford. I want to get involved with the vibrant Palo Alto community and help our society’s children and families get the lifesaving care they deserve.
<br>
In order to support the hospital I have signed up to run in the Summer Scamper – a 10k race benefiting the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital. Encouraged by your support and propelled by my study legs, I hope to raise money so that the Packard Children’s, a not-for-profit hospital, can treat any child in the community who needs specialized care, regardless of their family’s financial means.
<br>
Every dollar you give will make a difference:
<br>
$30 can provide a coping kit for a child facing a difficult procedure<br>
$60 can provide a week of vaccines or antibiotics for the Teen Health Van<br>
$110 can provide a child with a session of pain management services to supplement
medication<br>
$525 can cover the cost of two comprehensive blood tests <br>
Thank you for helping me reach my goal of giving back to the community and to support children’s health!<br>
